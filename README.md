# Artemisa y el camino al Sol

*This is our game for the Women Game Jam Bolivia :D*  
We made this in Unity, we had to learn it while developing, but it was sooo funnyðŸ˜‚

You can check the "final version" (the version we presented in WGJ) at the branch *develop*.  

You can also download the .exe [here](https://sofie-torch.itch.io/artemisa-y-el-camino-al-sol)
